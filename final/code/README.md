# Part1
You can train the network in part 1 by `python train.py`. It only takes few seconds.

You can get results from normal hyperparameter setting, 128 hidden layers dimension, 0.0001 learning rate and an image from my collection

# Part2
I have provided the checkpoints model parameters in 100 epochs in the `./code`

You can run `python sample.py` to get lego videos of back and white background.

To train the network described in part 2, you can run the command `python train_3d.py`. Please note that the training process takes approximately 4 hours to complete.
